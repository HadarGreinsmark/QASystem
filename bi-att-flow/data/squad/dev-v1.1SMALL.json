After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Warsaw was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia.

Only in 1918 did it regain independence from the foreign rule and emerge as a new capital of the independent Republic of Poland. The German invasion in 1939, the massacre of the Jewish population and deportations to concentration camps led to the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943 and to the major and devastating Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944.

Names such as French, (De) Roche, Devereux, D'Arcy, Treacy and Lacy are particularly common in the southeast of Ireland, especially in the southern part of County Wexford where the first Norman settlements were established. Other Norman names such as Furlong predominate there. Another common Norman-Irish name was Morell (Murrell) derived from the French Norman name Morel. Other names beginning with Fitz (from the Norman for son) indicate Norman ancestry. These included Fitzgerald, FitzGibbons (Gibbons) dynasty, Fitzmaurice.

In 1943, a Supreme Court of the United States decision restored the prior patents of Tesla, Oliver Lodge, and John Stone. The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patents were questionable, he could not claim infringement on those same patents (there are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the U.S. government by the Marconi Company via simply restoring Tesla's prior patent).", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 3, "text": "1900"}, {"answer_start": 3, "text": "1900"}, {"answer_start": 3, "text": "1900"}], "question": "When did Tesla attain his electrical transmitter patent?", "id": "56e0fc3f7aa994140058e877"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 132, "text": "Marconi"}, {"answer_start": 122, "text": "Guglielmo Marconi"}, {"answer_start": 122, "text": "Guglielmo Marconi"}], "question": "Who first sent radio waves across the Atlantic?", "id": "56e0fc3f7aa994140058e878"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 203, "text": "1901"}, {"answer_start": 203, "text": "1901"}, {"answer_start": 203, "text": "1901"}], "question": "When was Marconi's radio demonstration?", "id": "56e0fc3f7aa994140058e879"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 476, "text": "1943"}, {"answer_start": 476, "text": "1943"}, {"answer_start": 476, "text": "1943"}], "question": "When were Tesla's patents restored?", "id": "56e0fc3f7aa994140058e87a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 484, "text": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, {"answer_start": 484, "text": "Supreme Court of the United States"}, {"answer_start": 484, "text": "Supreme Court of the United States"}], "question": "A decision made by what entity restored Tesla's patents?", "id": "56e0fc3f7aa994140058e87b"}]}, {"context": "On 17 May 1899, Tesla moved to Colorado Springs, where he would have room for his high-voltage, high-frequency experiments; his lab was located near Foote Ave. and Kiowa St. He chose this location because the polyphase alternating current power distribution system had been introduced there and he had associates who were willing to give him all the power he needed without charging for it.
